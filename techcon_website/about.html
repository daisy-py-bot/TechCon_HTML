                TechCon began its journey in 2001 as a modest gathering of around 200 tech enthusiasts and industry professionals in San Francisco. The inaugural event, focused on emerging internet technologies during the height of the dot-com boom, set the stage for what would become one of the most influential technology conferences in the world.
